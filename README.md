# MyCSharpRoadMap

Hello all, I'm Ekin, I'm 23 years old and I started C# programming 2 months ago. I share with you in order to share with you the new things I learned every day during my education and journey and to understand how to use the Github platform more actively and correctly. It is to make RoadMap an easy and understandable guide for beginners like me.
